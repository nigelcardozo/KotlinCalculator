# KotlinCalculator
This is a very basic calculator that was developed purely to become familiar with Kotlin.

As I wanted to transition from Java to Kotlin, I developed this purely for learning Kotlin. 

I used the MVP architectural pattern along with Koin for Dependency Injection and MocKK for unit testing.
